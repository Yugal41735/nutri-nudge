## Overview

**NutriNudge** is a browser extension designed to help users make informed food choices by providing detailed health analyses of packaged food products. The extension scans product pages and uses AI-powered analysis to provide insights on nutritional value, harmful ingredients, allergen information, and suitability for specific dietary preferences like vegetarian or diabetes-friendly diets. The goal of NutriNudge is to empower consumers to understand the impact of their food choices on health in a simple and user-friendly way.

- **Health Impact**: Detailed analysis of ingredients and processing levels, highlighting harmful substances.
- **Dietary Preferences**: Provides insights for special dietary needs, such as diabetes, allergies, and vegetarian options.
- **OpenFoodFacts Integration**: Uses OpenFoodFacts API to fetch information not available directly on product pages.
- **Gemini AI Integration**: Uses the Gemini model for generating a health analysis report.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For DOM manipulation and handling events.
- **HTML/CSS**: For designing the extension's popup and modal interface.
- **Node.js/Express**: For backend support and integration with Gemini AI.
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini Model)**: To provide health-related insights.
- **OpenFoodFacts API**: To fetch nutritional information for products.


## Future Opportunities

- **Multi-Platform Support**: Extend support for other popular grocery platforms such as BigBasket and Swiggy Instamart.
- **Mobile Plugin**: Develop a mobile app version to analyze products in mobile grocery apps.
- **UI Enhancement**: Directly update product pages with health information to provide an in-context view for users.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provide users with healthier alternative products based on their preferences.

## Challenges Faced

- **Handling Missing Product Information**: Some product pages lacked necessary details, which led us to use OpenFoodFacts API to fill in the gaps.
- **CORS Issues with APIs**: Faced challenges related to cross-origin requests during integration with external APIs.
- **JavaScript Parsing**: Parsing raw output from the Gemini AI required careful sanitization, including removing unwanted JSON markers like backticks.
